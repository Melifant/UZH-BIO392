## SOD1 in the Ensembl database  

For the following search results in Ensembl the GRCh38 reference genome was used.  

SOD1 belongs to a protein familiy with one other member. Furthermore it has 2 paralogues and 221 orthologues. 
One of the paralogue is also a superoxidase dismutase and the other one is a copper chaperone for superoxidase dismutase.  
There are four splice variants which two of them are non-protein coding and the other two seem to be nearly identical and both of them are transcribing for a superoxidase dismutase.  

The variant table shows that SOD1 has a lot of  variants distributed over the whole gene sequence.  
In numbers, out of 1458 lsited variants 152 are associated with a disease. Moreover, majority of these variants are associated with ALS.
